# Text-Mining
Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. It is also known as text data mining. 

Text mining uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, like information extraction, to transform unstructured documents into a structured format to enable analysis and the generation of high-quality insights. 

By applying advanced analytical techniques, such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other deep learning algorithms, companies are able to explore and discover hidden relationships within their unstructured data.

### Sentimental Analysis 
Sentiment analysis is the process of classifying whether a block of text is positive, negative, or neutral. It is a popular task in natural language processing. 

Sentiment analysis combines machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to achieve this. Using basic sentiment analysis, a program can understand whether the sentiment behind a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. The goal of sentiment analysis is to classify the text based on the mood or mentality expressed in the text.
